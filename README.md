🧠 AI Layer & Methodology WE developed a system that moves beyond simple static rules. The defense relies on a Random Forest Classifier trained to recognize the "fingerprints" of network anomalies.Model: Random Forest (Ensemble Learning)Key Features: * Request Rate: Monitoring frequency of incoming HTTP requests.Packet Size: Analyzing data volume to detect malformed or oversized payloads.Response Logic: Automated IP blacklisting triggered upon anomaly detection.📁 Repository StructureFilePurposesimulate_traffic.pyGenerates a synthetic dataset of "Normal" vs "Attack" traffic for training.network_traffic.csvThe structured dataset (1200+ samples) containing network features.train_ai.pyTraining script that optimizes the Random Forest model and calculates accuracy.traffic_model.pklThe Serialized AI Brain; the trained model ready for deployment.ai_monitor.pyThe real-time inference engine that monitors live traffic.🚀 Deployment WorkflowData Generation: Execute simulate_traffic.py to establish a baseline of network behavior.Model Training: Run train_ai.py to generate the intelligence file (.pkl).Live Monitoring: Deploy ai_monitor.py to intercept ESP32 traffic logs and trigger defenses.👨‍💻 Developed By:Misbah Ullah
